# FreeCodeCampChallenges

This repository is dedicated to all challenges available on FreeCodeCamp courses. How each project works is described here!

FreeCodeCamp is a nonprofit organization, their mission is to help people learn to code for free. Here's a link to their website: https://www.freecodecamp.org/

Happy Coding!

# How to Run Each Project

## Responsive Web Design

In this course, the basic about HTML5 and CSS3 is shown. We learned about animation using CSS and about Displays FlexBox and Grid Layout. Furthermore, a basic 
introduction to color theory is given too.

All challenges in this course uses only HTML5 and CSS3.

### Build a Tribute Page

The first challenge is to build a Tribute Page. The person I choose to talk about was Ada Lovelace. The page have a photo of Ada and a succinct timeline of Adas life. At the bottom, there is a link to her Wikipedia's page if someone wishes to learn more about her.

To make this page, I used display Flex to centralize the content.

### Build a Survey Form

This challenge consists in building a Survey Form. I decided to clone the page they give as an example ( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP ) to complete this challenge.

I used display Flex to align all elements and content of the page. For the dropdown, I used the element select, I tried to use datalist but it wasn't behaving as I would like to. For the background I searched an image that was pretty an used linear-gradient( ) to make the same job as the filter in CSS.

### Build a Product Landing Page

This challenge consists in building a Product Landing Page. I decided to clone the page they give as an example ( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL ) to complete this challenge.

I used display Flex to align all elements and content of the page. To make the navigation bar I've learned to use sections. Also, I discovered the tag <iframe> and how to embed an YouTube video on this project. YouTube itself makes the process very easy, the process is: choose a video you want to embed, in share optionS there is a type of sharing named "Embed", then copy the HTML and paste on your code.

### Build a Technical Documentation Page

This challenge consists in building a Technical Documentation Page. I decided to clone the page they give as an example ( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL ) to complete this challenge.

I am very proud of this one, because it is a very responsive website! I mainly used rem unit and media query so everything works well. Also, I used display Flex to align all content.

On the left we can see a navigation bar so we can easily navigate throughout the topics.

### Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

The last challenge consists in building a Personal Portfolio Webpage. I decided to clone the page they give as an example ( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG ) to complete this challenge, giving it littles changes.

First we have an introduction. On the top, we have a navigation bar with an animation when you hover over it. It is a different hover then the one from the example. I wanted to do something different, so I animated a line growing from the left till the end of each element on the navigation bar. To make this, I watched a video from Cand Dev named "Create Underline Button Hover Effects | Pure CSS" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R033rKs6sgA&t=699s&ab_channel=CandDev ). He uses a very interesting approach, I really recommend his video.

Second we have the projects presentation. I loved the animation they bring in the example and I was very happy to create it by myself only trying somethings. For the first time I used ::after and ::before to create the characters '<' and '/>', basically they have the same background color as the cards, but when you hover over them, they change color and become visible.

At last we have the contact part. I tried to use icons with similar design so the page looks consistent. Here I made different from de example as well, the contacts goes up and not down as on the exampla page. I used transform: translateY() to do the hover effect and this ends all FreeCodeCamp challenges under the course "Responsive Web Design".

## About the Challenges

I liked a lot doing this challenges. I had to search so many things and learned a lot. I think that the project that I learned the most from was the Survey Form page, there was so much information and learn the HTML semantics to make a good survey form was insane!
