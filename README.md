## Responsive Web Design

In this course, the basic about HTML5 and CSS3 is shown. We learned about animation using CSS and about Displays FlexBox and Grid Layout. Furthermore, a basic 
introduction to color theory is given too.

All challenges in this course uses only HTML5 and CSS3.

### Build a Tribute Page

The first challenge is to build a Tribute Page. The person I choose to talk about was Ada Lovelace. The page have a photo of Ada and a succinct timeline of Adas life. At the bottom, there is a link to her Wikipedia's page if someone wishes to learn more about her.

To make this page, I used display Flex to centralize the content.

### Build a Survey Form

This challenge consists in building a Survey Form. I decided to clone the page they give as an example ( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP ) to complete this challenge.

I used display Flex to align all elements and content of the page. For the dropdown, I used the element select, I tried to use datalist but it wasn't behaving as I would like to. For the background I searched an image that was pretty an used linear-gradient( ) to make the same job as the filter in CSS.
